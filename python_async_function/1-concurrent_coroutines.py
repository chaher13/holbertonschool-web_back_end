"""
Import wait_random from the previous python file
that youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n
that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay.
You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort()
because of concurrency.

    Asynchronously executes `n` tasks with a maximum delay
    of `max_delay` and returns a sorted list of the delays.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of tasks to create.
        max_delay (int): The maximum delay for each task.

    Returns:
        List[float]: A sorted list of floats representing
        the delays of the completed tasks.

    Example Usage:
        delays = await wait_n(3, 5)
