"""
Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written
and write an async routine called wait_n
that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay.
You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort()
because of concurrency.
